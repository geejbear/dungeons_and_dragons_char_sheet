# Dungeons and Dragons 
A simple **python** script that renders a basic Dongeons and Dragons character all a character sheet,
but hopefully cutting some edges regarding decision making while creating a character, as well
as making some variables randmomizable.
All of the game's variables, as well as naming conventions have been extracted from the
Basic Rules' hanbook, published in November 2018 and available for free in the official game's
website.
